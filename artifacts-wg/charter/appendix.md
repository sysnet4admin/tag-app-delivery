# Artifacts WG Charter Appendix 

## Problem Statements
* As an artifact consumer, I need to discover attributes about every component used or potentially used in my system. I need consistent practices and patterns for querying for these attributes across many artifact types.
* As an artifact provider, I need to deliver a complete set of components to a runtime platform which may be fully disconnected from the environment from where those components are developed or assembled. I want consistent practices for bundling and deploying different component types.
* As a security analyst, I need to understand and verify the content of bundles used in software and deployed on my platforms.
* [Proposed] As a platform operator I need a consistent pattern and implementation for deploying bundles to provide additional platform capabilities. For example, I need a consistent pattern for adding extension controller-managers (operators) to Kubernetes.
