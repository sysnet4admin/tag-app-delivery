## 플랫폼
A platform aggregates capabilities to serve developers and operators in
development and delivery of products, services and apps. In reference to the
scenarios it aims to support, a platform may be named a "Developer Platform", a
"Delivery Platform", an "App Platform" or even a "Cloud Platform." The
connotations of the older term "Platform-as-a-Service", or PaaS, are also
influential.

## 플랫폼 기능 제공자
The projects and systems that provide the core capabilities offered by the platform.
Providers can be maintained by either external organizations or internal teams,
and capabilities can be infrastructure, runtime, or other supporting services.

## 플랫폼 엔지니어링
The practice of building and maintaining shared platforms and capabilities and presenting them to end users. Emerging from the DevOps movement's goal of cooperation between application developers and operators, platform engineering proposes using common platforms as the foundation of that cooperation. The decision to use shared platforms impacts not only the technology but also the people, processes, policies and expected business outcomes at an organization.

## 플랫폼 엔지니어
The role focused on developing and 
maintaining interfaces and tools to enable provisioning and integration of platform 
capabilities in applications, according to the requirements and instructions provided 
by platform product managers. Platform developers are usually grouped in platform teams.

## 플랫폼 제품 관리자
The role chiefly responsible for understanding the experience of
platform users, building a roadmap that addresses platform product gaps, requirements, 
and opportunities, and managing platform teams as a part of daily work.

## 플랫폼 팀
A cross-functional team that develops and maintains interfaces to and experiences with
platform capabilities - like Web portals, custom APIs, and golden path templates.  

Platform teams are managed by platform product managers and involve
platform developers. As the platform evolves and become more advanced, other roles 
can become part of a platform team, including, but not limited to, operators, 
QA analysts, UI/UX designers, technical writers, developer advocates.

## 플랫폼 사용자
The target audience for a platform which includes but is not limited to app developers and operators, data
scientists, COTS software operators, and information workers - whoever runs
software on the platform or uses platform provided capabilities.

## 가장 얇은 실행 가능한 플랫폼 (TVP) {#tvp}
A concept originally defined in the book *Team Topologies*
by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. The definition says: "A TVP is a careful balance between 
keeping the platform small and ensuring that the platform is helping to accelerate and simplify 
software delivery for teams building on the platform."
