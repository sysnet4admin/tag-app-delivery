## Proposed Schedule
*inspired by https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/138*
- [x] Due February 10th, 2021
* Tasking Assignment - people interested in content generation for a particular topic area comment on the corresponding GitHub issue and the topic gets assigned to them

* Update - we will keep assignements open throughout the "Content-rough-in" weeks and [Jen](https://github.com/jenniferstrej), [Thomas](https://github.com/thschue) and [Omer](https://github.com/OmerKahani) will pick them up on a FIFO basis.

- [x] February 10th - March 15th, 2021  - *Content-rough-in*
* Members generate content for the respective area of assignment. Cohesive sentences, concepts, phrasing, etc. should be placed in quotations ("") for later review as whole content.

* Content rough in will be pulled into a clean working document (single markdown) for review

- [x] March 15th - April 1st, 2021 - *Collaborative review*
* Members will comment and review the content of the draft

- [x] April 1st - April 7th, 2021 - *Executive summary and content wrap up*

- [x] April 7th - April 20th, 2021 - *Narrative voice*
  

* The narrative voice is a semi-final pass of the paper to ensure it reads
  as a single, unified voice.  It should ensure:
  * the language origin is consistent throughout the document (lang_en or lang_us),
  * phrasing is similar (caddy corner not mixed in with kitty corner),
  * acronyms are spelled out at their first use and then abbrieviated later,
  * footnotes and citations are consistent and not direct hyperlinks in the text
  * vague terms are defined in a glossary or otherwise cited to the cloud native security lexicon in the repo

- [X] April 20th - April 30th, 2021 - *Final group review*
* Final Review - final review by group, with selected "intended audience"

- [ ] From April 30th, 2021 - *Publishing Process*
