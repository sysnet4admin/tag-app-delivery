CNCF TAG App Delivery maintains and publishes this paper describing platforms
for cloud-native computing to support project maintainers and cloud users in
planning and designing such platforms.

Currently, the edition in the `latest` directory is published to TAG App
Delivery's website at <https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms>.
